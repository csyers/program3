Programming Assignment 3: Prototype FTP Connection

INCLUDED FILES:
    README - this readme file
    server - server subdirectory
        myftpd.c - source code of server
        Makefile - makefile for server
        SmallFile.txt - link to test file 1
        MediumFile.pdf - link to test file 2
        LargeFile.pdf - link to test file 3
    client - client subdirectory
        myftp.c - source code of client
        Makefile - makefile for client

This directory contains two subdirectories - one for the client and one 
for the server. To start the server, change into the server directory and 
type the command:

$ make

This will create an executable called myftpd. To start the server, use the 
follwing command:

$ ./myftpd portno

where portno is any port (41010 used for testing). On another studnet machine,
change into the client subdirectory and type:

$ make

to create the client executable, called myftp. To run the client, type:

$ ./myftp hostname portno

where hostname is the hostname of the machine running the server, and portno
is the port number the server was started with.

From there, follow the prompt at the client to use the FTP.

Examples (at server):

> LIS
(lists directory contents)
> REQ
---> SmallFile.txt
(gets the SmallFile.txt)
> MKD
---> test
(creates directory named test)
> CHD
---> test
(moves to test directory)
> UPL
---> SmallFile.txt
(puts SmallFile.txt in test directory)
> DEL
---> SmallFile.txt
(removes file)
> CHD
---> ..
(moves up a level)
> RMD
---> test
(removes test directory)
> XIT
(exits program)
